# Welcome to the Buggy App!

This project is a buggy application that demonstrates various common software engineering bugs. This code was generated by copilot agents and has not had formal QA.

# The Coding Task
There are over a dozen intentional bugs in the codebase. 

Create a feature branch, fix what bugs you can find, and submit a pull request.

In the PR description, please add a comment w brief description for each of the bugs you fixed. 

Open a second branch/PR; describe and/or demonstrate any architectural or functional improvements you would make to the service to improve performance, scalability, or security.

Once you're done, assign me as reviewer and I'll review your code.

Thanks and happy coding!

# Hints for Finding Bugs

The following hints (without giving away answers) to help you find the bugs in the codebase.

## Areas to Investigate

### 1. Input Validation

- Are all required fields validated?
- Are field formats checked (e.g., zip codes, coordinates)?
- What about ranges and boundaries?

### 2. Security

- Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- What information is exposed in error messages?
- How is CORS configured?

### 3. Data Handling

- Are database queries using the correct operators?
- Are types handled consistently?
- What about NULL values?

### 4. Concurrency and Transactions

- Are there any race conditions in concurrent operations?
- Are transactions properly managed?
- What happens if multiple users modify the same data simultaneously?

### 5. API Design

- Do HTTP status codes follow REST conventions?
- Are responses consistent?
- Is error handling appropriate?

### 6. Application Lifecycle

- Is the application handling shutdown signals properly?
- What about different types of termination?


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

2. If you encounter database binding errors with `better-sqlite3`, rebuild the native module:
```bash
# Using npm
npm rebuild better-sqlite3

# Using pnpm
pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The server will start on port 3000 by default.
